# CS210

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project I chose is the Corner Grocer Scenario. The goal of the project is to create a program that correctly displays how often produce items are purchased.

#What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job manually refactoring the code to correct pre-existing errors.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my knowledge of the correct classes to implement when executing code.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Writing code comes with many challenges, but my  largest was creating the class that execute correctly. I used the class creating tool as well as the building tool to create a class that would allow me to utilize the strings needed to produce successful code.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The ability to write code as well as the ability to refactor code.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made it maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adjusting the code based on errors that occured while running the program.
